So it's not crystal clear what to choose between Canada and India. Although it seems more tempting to choose Canada, there are good chances that India might actually be a better choice because of the large number of potential customers.

At this point, it seems that we have several options:

1. Advertise in the US, India, and Canada by splitting the advertisement budget in various combinations:
    - 60% for the US, 25% for India, 15% for Canada.
    - 50% for the US, 30% for India, 20% for Canada; etc.

2. Advertise only in the US and India, or the US and Canada. Again, it makes sense to split the advertisement budget unequally. For instance:
    - 70% for the US, and 30% for India.
    - 65% for the US, and 35% for Canada; etc.

3. Advertise only in the US.

At this point, it's probably best to send our analysis to the marketing team and let them use their domain knowledge to decide. They might want to do some extra surveys in India and Canada and then get back to us for analyzing the new survey data.

# Conclusion

In this project, we analyzed survey data from new coders to find the best two markets to advertise in. The only solid conclusion we reached is that the US would be a good market to advertise in.

For the second best market, it wasn't clear-cut what to choose between India and Canada. We decided to send the results to the marketing team so they can use their domain knowledge to take the best decision.
