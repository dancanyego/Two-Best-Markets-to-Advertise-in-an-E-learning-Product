    "# Finding the Two Best Markets to Advertise in an E-learning Product\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll aim to find the two best markets to advertise our product in â€” we're working for an e-learning company that offers courses on programming. Most of our courses are on web and mobile development, but we also cover many other domains, like data science, game development, etc.\n",

    "# Understanding the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid spending money on organizing a survey, we'll first try to make use of existing data to determine whether we can reach any reliable result.\n",
    "\n",
    "One good candidate for our purpose is [freeCodeCamp's 2017 New Coder Survey](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/we-asked-20-000-people-who-they-are-and-how-theyre-learning-to-code-fff5d668969). [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is a free e-learning platform that offers courses on web development. Because they run [a popular Medium publication](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/) (over 400,000 followers), their survey attracted new coders with varying interests (not only web development), which is ideal for the purpose of our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The survey data is publicly available in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey). Below, we'll do a quick exploration of the `2017-fCC-New-Coders-Survey-Data.csv` file stored in the `clean-data` folder of the repository we just mentioned. We'll read in the file using the direct link [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey/master/clean-data/2017-fCC-New-Coders-Survey-Data.csv)."
